Bound attributes:

	When initializing one parameter, to use the parameter itself
	and not the value. This way it is less prone to error in case
	another programmer were to change something.

	Even though the usage of creating a macro would fulfill this,
	this is still better practice in my opinion. Not that the two
	things can't be used. Use the macro to set the parameter, but
	instead of using the macro later on, use the parameter if
	it is within scope.
