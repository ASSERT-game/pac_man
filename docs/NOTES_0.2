Coding is relatively easy, coding good however is not. Not going to
write the code to make the main menu possible. Context switching /
level switching is rather difficult to do well. Perhaps it is better
to get some sprites on screen and code their animation and as I go
on to begin to iterate on the design.

Having the ability to architect something comes with experience,
but I wont get that experience if I try do it well the first time
around I guess. It is a problem of sufficiently knowing more
but not knowing enough. I know the ways to solve the problem
if they arise, but I do not yet know how to solve for avoiding the
problems.

I'll let go of some of the shackles that bind me, and just write
code that does stuff...
