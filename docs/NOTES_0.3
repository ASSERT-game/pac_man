Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

I could think about the merits about checking after the fact whether
the player is inside a wall, or not allow them to get there in the first place.
Then think about which of these is better in the sense of optimization, readability
maintainability and so on, and try to optimize these seven or so different variables,
but I would end up writing this code by next year. So for now I won't put too much thought
into it. Might come back to this later, might not.
