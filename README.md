# PacMan

Because learning to make this is easier than learning to make
a [3D rendering engine](https://github.com/ASSERT-game/ASSERT_game2). But only by a small margin. Your results
may vary. A Pacman recreation implemented in C and the SDL2.0 graphics Library.

The game plays fast, as I heard the original arcade one does. Ghost move according the rules by the original one.
The crosshairs are the target tiles of each ghost. Lives are gained after a certain amount of pellets are consumed, also there is a special attack with spacebar that freezes the ghost in place, but be careful to not run into them! The ghost have different states, Chasing, Frightened and Scatter mode.

There is quite a bit more that I would like to add, see [TODO](https://github.com/ASSERT-game/pac_man/blob/master/TODO) file. Was fun to play, and constantly get beaten by my own creation.
